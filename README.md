This repository contains my solutions to various CodeWars katas. Please note that the solutions
here are not focused on clean code; rather, they are intended to provide quick and dirty solutions
using chain function calls and minimal variable naming.

## Languages

I have solved katas in the following languages:
- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- C#

Please keep in mind that the primary goal of these solutions is to quickly solve CodeWars katas.
They may not follow best coding practices or be the most efficient, but they serve as a way to
demonstrate problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

Feel free to explore the solutions and learn from them, and if you have any suggestions or 
improvements, I'd love to hear from you!
